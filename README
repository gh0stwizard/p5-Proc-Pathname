Proc-Pathname version 0.08
==========================

Proc::Pathname - Retrieves the fully qualified path for the program

A common way to retrieve a path for the program is using the variables 
$0 and $^X. However, sometimes it is not working for you. So, you have 
to find a way to retrieve the path for the program somehow differently.

The module is using system calls to do the job and written as XS module.
This module was made for mine private purposes, mostly, for staticperl.

BUGS

Completely broken on OpenBSD as of version 0.08, because of
OpenBSD does not provide a suitable way to determine
a location of a running process. Current implementation is
based on the program `which' and it tries to find a path 
via the PATH environment variable.
