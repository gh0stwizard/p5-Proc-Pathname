Proc-Pathname version 0.05
==========================

Proc::Pathname - Retrieves the fully qualified path for the program

A common way to retrieve a path for the program is using the variable $0.
However, sometimes it is not working for you. So, you have to find a way
to retrieve the path for the program somehow differently.

The module is using system calls to do the job and written as XS module.
This module was made for mine private purposes, mostly, for staticperl.
